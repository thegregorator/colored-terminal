/*******************************************************************************
 ********************* Configuration for colored-terminal **********************
 *******************************************************************************
 *
 * The configuration file is an array of rule dictionaries, which each consist
 * of a path matcher and a set of colors.
 *
 * Rules are processed from first to last, so rules further down can override
 * earlier rules.
 *
 *
 * Path matchers can be defined using:
 *  - "path"       - Matches a directory and its subdirectories.
 *  - "singlePath" - Matches a single directory.
 *  - "pathRegex"  - Matches a directory with a regular expression.
 *                   Can be of the format "expr" or "/expr/flags".
 *
 *
 * Colors can be defined using a dictionary with "fg"/"bg" entries for 
 * foreground/background colors.
 *
 * Non-dictionary colors are treated as background colors (x == {"bg": x}).
 *
 * Color values can be specified using formats supported by CSS:
 *  - "#438"
 *  - "#483D8B"
 *  - "rgb(72, 61, 139)"
 *  - "rgba(72, 61, 139, 1)" (transparent fg colors will be blended with the bg)
 *  - "darkslateblue"
 *
